## About the data

The New York Philharmonic played its first concert on December 7, 1842.

The data documents all known concerts, amounting to more than 20,000 performances.

The [Leon Levy Digital Archives](https://archives.nyphil.org/) provides an interface for searching printed programs alongside other digitized items.

We organized the performances as follows:

* The Program is the top-most level element in our dataset
* A Program is defined as performances in which the repertoire, conductors, and soloists are the same
* A Program is associated with an Orchestra (e.g., New York Philharmonic) and a Season (e.g., 1842-43)
* A Program may have multiple Concerts with different dates, times and locations
* A Program's repertoire may contain numerous Works (e.g., two different symphonies by Beethoven)
* A Work can have multiple Soloists (e.g., Mahler on the harpsichord, Strauss or Bernstein on the piano or Isadora Duncan listed as a dancer).
